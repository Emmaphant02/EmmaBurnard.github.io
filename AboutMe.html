											<p>I had a huge love of reading and creative writing from early childhood through to my first years

												 of highschool I developed my cooking skills, after baking with my Mum for many years. YouTube 
												 broadened my ability to observe hobbies and skills like embroidery, pattern sewing, nail art, 
												 and gaming.</p>

										<h2>Why TAS teaching?</h2> <!--idea help-->
										<p>I have always loved helping people, and I possess a passion for learning and communicating that knowledge to others. As both of my parents are teachers, and they have shown me the value in guiding students as they mature into their own person. I want to be a teacher that shows a dedication to one’s work that can be observed and felt by the students so that they know they matter in my classroom. I hope to prioritise understanding how children learn and excel at different tasks in order to help them achieve their personal best all while in a comfortable and supportive learning environment. I will aim to encourage positive interpersonal skills like openness, trust, and ability to share and model honestly, tolerance, and mutual respect.</p>
										<h4>Specifically as a TAS teacher, I want to serve as a role model to the girls in my classrooms so that they can feel confident to enjoy sometimes dirty, hands-on work. I also equally want to encourage boys to find value in household skills like cooking and textiles. 
										</h4>
										<br>
										<p>My role models I have looked up to throughout my life have been teachers, most influential being my TAS teacher throughout highschool. I admired the way he is relaxed but driven, creating a well balanced and supportive classroom environment. He also spends time individually with every student to help picture and realise their visions. One can feel the dedication he has to his craft, ensuring an enriching experience for his students. With his guidance, I achieved a SHAPE nomination for my major work in design, contributing to me receiving a high ATAR. I saw my Dad be able to translate something he already loved into a new role. I have always been told to make what you enjoy and are good at into your job, so this was a huge encouragement and I believe helped me to deeper understand the syllabus and expectations that I can use to guide students. My dream is to be just like Mr Groves, and similarly have decades of students find inspiration through my work ethic and positive attitude.
										</p>
										<p>I think education is important because it equips children to become capable adults who are able to understand and make use of their unique personal skills and the world around them. I admire the support and care my mum shows as she guides deaf students towards succeeding in their HSC. Not every child is born to parents who have the capability to teach or care for them, so schools have the opportunity to instill self efficacy and facilitate creativity. In theory, education - and therefore a teacher - is supposed to level the playing field.
										</p>

										<h2>My student background</h2>
										<br>
										<p>I was raised in a middle-class family with married parents, a younger brother and a cat. Both of my parents completed tertiary education, a Bachelor of Engineering for my Dad, who worked at Bridgestone tires and related companies until late primary school, where he decided to undertake a Master of Teaching online to become a TAS teacher. My Mum was a teacher before her own children were a thought, with a Masters of Special Education on top of her Bachelor of Primary Teaching. Her specialisation in speech development led her to ensure that she made time to read books with us every night, developing our clear speaking and literacy skills. I went through two years of Preschool before starting Kindergarten young for my year. Composite classes saw me pick up on the year-above’s work and understand it, sometimes succeeding them. I passed entry to attend an academic selective highschool where I was surrounded with like-minded students, there were minimal behavioural problems and interests nurturing from teachers to learn and achieve.</p>
