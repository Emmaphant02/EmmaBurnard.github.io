											<h2>My Philosophy behind teaching</h2>
											<p>Let's have a look at the child development theories and pedagogy I look to for my method 
												of teaching.</p>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/CalmStudents.png" alt="" /></a>
										<h2>Influential Historical Figures</h2><br>
											<p>I admire figures like Professor Francis Anderson and his 1901 speech rejecting the 
											colonial/industrial based system, in particular rote learning (Campbell, 2013).
											He asserted that teachers should be free from rigidities and allowed to modify the ways 
											they teach the curriculum to their students. I believe that this can be done effectively 
											with continuous evaluation.
											<br>Maria Montessori and Friedrich Froebel 
											Creative learning environments where children could make, do, experiment, move, sing,
											 dance, and discuss to drive their own education (Campbell, 2013). 
											My view aligns with their flexibility and student-centred approach with teachers taking 
											on a subtle and friendly educator role, focusing on their ‘natural curiosity’. 
											<br>Plato also shared these views long before, firmly claiming that children should be 
											watched to identify their ‘nature’ and receive an education catered to them (Noddings, 2003).
											</p>
										<h2>Why does education matter for society?</h2><br>
											<p>Mandatory education matters for society because not every child is born to parents who 
											have the capability to teach or care for them. By increasingly educating each 
											generation, the hope is that the effect of this cycle may break or slowly lessen over 
											time. In theory, education is supposed to level the playing field.
											<br>Constructivist philosopher and psychologist John Dewey states that 
											the purpose of education is to continue the “ideals, hopes, expectations, standards 
											and opinions from those members of society who are passing out of the group life to 
											those who are coming into it” as well as “customs, institutions, beliefs…and 
											occupations.” (Dewey, 1918, pp. 2-4). 
											<br>Dewey is a believer in enquiry and constructivist learning, allowing children 
											to reflect on their experiences and meld new information into what they already know,
												with the community contributing different perspectives. 
											</p>
										<h2>What do I believe makes an ethical teacher?</h2><br>
											<p>An ethical teacher should treat every student with equal fairness and the same 
												(or specialised if required) care. Ethical high school teachers understand that 
												their class isn’t the only one that each student needs to balance and work on and 
												adjusts their presented workload accordingly to not over burden them. Ethical 
												teachers also recognise external factors that may be affecting a student’s 
												wellbeing, doing their best to create and maintain a safe, supportive and 
												comfortable environment for students to be able to work through whatever 
												situation they are facing. Although teachers cannot take the role of councillor, 
												an open and friendly attitude can allow for students to reach out if they feel 
												they need to. One must present oneself in an ethical manner if they expect students 
												to model this behaviour and learn basic moral principles.</p>
										<h2>My Personal Philosophy Statement</h2> <br>
											<p>I want to be a teacher that similarly shows a dedication to one’s work that can 
												be observed and felt by the students so that they know they matter in my classroom.
												I hope to prioritise understanding how children learn and excel at different tasks
												in order to help them achieve their personal best all while in a comfortable and 
												supportive learning environment. I want to be authoritative, a balanced mix of 
												warmth while still maintaining control when required. I will encourage positive 
												interpersonal skills like openness, trust, and ability to share and model 
												honestly, tolerance and mutual respect. Specifically as a TAS teacher, I want to 
												serve as a role model to the girls in my classrooms so that they can feel 
												confident to enjoy sometimes dirty, hands-on work. I also equally want to 
												encourage boys to find value in household skills like cooking and textiles. 
												Although my field has set requirements to complete, I will strive to find 
												different ways of presenting information to stimulate children’s interests 
												and engage their learning styles.
												<br>I want to draw from Tait’s exploration of Giroux’ ideas about the hidden 
												curriculum. Specifically, he mentions that we learn how to get ahead by fitting in,
													“not rocking the boat” (2013, pg 24).
												<br>I aspire to be the teacher that enables children to feel comfortable to 
												question what they are being told. Sure, this may mean I will have to exercise 
												patience to answer why I tell my class to make specific wood joints when 
												functionally there isn’t much difference, but this allows them to determine 
												their own opinions and informed perspectives in life.

												<h3>Bourdieu’s concept of ‘habitus’ (1973)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Learned appreciation and value of education. Combined with my own experiences as a student:
												School was a good place to be, my study habits were encouraged and good grades were expected. <br>
												Bourdieu (1973) believes that parents with high expectations of ‘successful’ children have the power to negate some effects of poverty. 
												I hope that by creating a welcoming and reassuring environment, teachers may also have an influence this.
												I admire the support and care my Mother shows as she guides deaf students towards succeeding in their HSC. Dad is able to translate something he already loved into a new role.

												<h3>Australian Professional Standards for Teaching</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Based on the Australian Professional Standards for Teaching (Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership, 2017), teachers should:
												<br> - Have flexibility, organisation, supportiveness, self evaluate and seek feedback, use varied methods of teaching and assessment relevant to child needs, clear and concise instructions, manage challenging behaviour
												<br> - Model and set explicit, challenging and achievable learning goals for all students of varying abilities and characteristics to develop a healthy culture of high expectations
												<br> - Developing knowledge, skills, problem solving and critical and creative thinking.  Promote student responsibility for learning.
												<br> -Model, establish and implement inclusive and exemplary ethical behaviour and exercise informed judgements and interactions (with students and parents/carers) in order to create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments.
												<br> - Address the strengths and needs of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious, socioeconomic backgrounds and histories, providing opportunities for students to develop understanding and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages.
